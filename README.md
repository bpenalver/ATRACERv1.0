# ATRACERv2.0

Analyze data obtained from TRACER. It determines the most significant TF reporters as a function of time and/or other treatments.

This code was developed to analyze the data pertaining to the following paper

Peñalver Bernabé B, Shin S, Rios PD, Broadbelt  LJ, Shea LD, Seidlits S.  “A large-scale, real-time array to assess dynamic changes in intracellular signaling in response to biomaterial-mediated mechanical and adhesive stimuli” (in preparation)
